      <h2>A Student’s Guide to Note-Taking & Review</h2>

      <div class="intro-box">
        A question was asked to the brother regarding how can one have an effective note taking 
        and review as a student of knowledge. The questioner stated he has a problem with excessive 
        highlighting to the point of turning pages into colorful sheets. He is on his path of learning 
        the Deen, and the brother here clarifies how to properly take notes and review. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>May Allah increase us all in beneficial knowledge and make this a benefit for us all.</strong>
      </div>

      <h3>Introductory Reflections</h3>
      <p>When you are new to a book—especially if it’s a topic you haven’t read much about—everything seems new, every page feels like a discovery. This is beautiful, but if you try to take notes on everything, you will end up rewriting the book instead of learning from it.</p>

      <h3>On Taking Notes</h3>
      <p>Once you become more acquainted with the material, you can start taking notes selectively. At that point, fewer things will stand out as novel, and you’ll better identify what truly matters. Conservatism in highlighting and note-taking will make your study more fruitful in the long run.</p>

      <h3>On Memorization</h3>
      <p>Scholars mention two types of memorization:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Word-for-word memorization</strong>: precise and demanding, suitable mainly for Arabic texts like Qur’an and Hadith.</li>
        <li><strong>Memorization of meaning</strong>: understanding the gist, able to summarize in one’s own words. This is often more practical and should come before literal memorization.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>On Summarizing & Rereading</h3>
      <p>The best way to deeply understand a text is to summarize it in your own words. Authors may repeat or expand extensively; you condense while preserving meaning. This requires rereading the book multiple times until the core message is fully grasped.</p>

      <h3>On Reviewing & Retention</h3>
      <p>Continuous review is key. Memorization without revisiting leads to forgetting. Like renewing a subscription, one must constantly revisit material to keep it alive. Scholars advise reading even simple books five to ten times a year for mastery. Over time, excessive early highlights will feel unnecessary as the knowledge becomes part of you.</p>

      <h3>Final Advice</h3>
      <p>Highlight conservatively. Review often. Reread patiently. Knowledge remains with those who revisit and act upon it. With Allah’s permission, this process strengthens memory and understanding, making one’s journey as a student of knowledge productive and lasting.</p>
